                <h2>Lots of levels</h2>
                <p>The game is constantly evolving since it was first released, and currently it has more than 
                    12 different levels that you may encounter when you play. Its great variety makes the game 
                    lively and makes our players stay and tell others about the great time they've had. Our 
                    goal is to keep the game fresh and up-to-date with the expectatives of each season

                    possible in Fall Guys, because you'll have even more options of clothing for your character than
